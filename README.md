## Image Gallery With Lightbox Effect
---
# 📸 Project Overview

Image Gallery with Lightbox is a modern, responsive image gallery that enhances the user experience with a smooth lightbox effect. This project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing gallery that works seamlessly across all devices.

The gallery allows users to view images in an overlay with next/previous navigation and a close button, while keeping the rest of the page slightly visible in the background. All images have captions and alt-text to improve accessibility and SEO.
